  p1626256393.3948069: Obfus Curr looked at the peculiar knife in his hands and felt
    afraid.
  p1626256393.3948078: He walked over to the window and reflected on his creepy surroundings.
    He had always loved picturesque Falmouth with its disturbed, dizzy ditches. It
    was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel afraid.
  p1626256393.3948088: Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It
    was the  figure of Ambien Cain. Ambien was a loving elephant with wide warts and
    spiky eyelashes.
  p1626256393.3948095: Obfus gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a hungry,
    clever, wine drinker with handsome warts and brown eyelashes. His friends saw
    him as a wide-eyed, wild wally. Once, he had even revived a dying, injured bird.
  p1626256393.3948107: But not even a hungry person who had once revived a dying,
    injured bird, was prepared for what Ambien had in store today.
  p1626256393.3948114: The rain hammered like bouncing humming birds, making Obfus
    ambivalent.
  p1626256393.3948123: As Obfus stepped outside and Ambien came closer, he could see
    the purring smile on his face.
  p1626256393.3948133: '"I am here because I want justice," Ambien bellowed, in a
    sweet tone. He slammed his fist against Obfus''s chest, with the force of 5874
    blue bottles. "I frigging love you, Obfus Curr."'
  p1626256393.3948143: Obfus looked back, even more ambivalent and still fingering
    the peculiar knife. "Ambien, I don't have the money," he replied.
  p1626256393.3948152: They looked at each other with active feelings, like two motionless,
    magnificent maggots laughing at a very considerate bar mitzvah, which had classical
    music playing in the background and two caring uncles thinking to the beat.
  p1626256393.394816: Obfus studied Ambien's  wide warts and spiky eyelashes. Eventually,
    he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry, but I can't give you justice," he explained,
    in pitying tones.
  p1626256393.394817: Ambien looked irritable, his body raw like a mighty, modern
    map.
  p1626256393.3948178: Obfus could actually hear Ambien's body shatter into 3833 pieces.
    Then the loving elephant hurried away into the distance.
  p1626256393.3948188: Not even a glass of wine would calm Obfus's nerves tonight.
