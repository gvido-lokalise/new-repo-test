    p1626256393.3948078: 'He walked over to the window and reflected on his creepy surroundings. He had always loved picturesque Falmouth with its disturbed, dizzy ditches. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel afraid.'
    p1626256393.3948088: 'Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the  figure of Ambien Cain. Ambien was a loving elephant with wide warts and spiky eyelashes.'
    p1626256393.3948095: 'Obfus gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a hungry, clever, wine drinker with handsome warts and brown eyelashes. His friends saw him as a wide-eyed, wild wally. Once, he had even revived a dying, injured bird.'
    p1626256393.3948107: 'But not even a hungry person who had once revived a dying, injured bird, was prepared for what Ambien had in store today.'
    p1626256393.3948114: 'The rain hammered like bouncing humming birds, making Obfus ambivalent.'
    p1626256393.3948123: 'As Obfus stepped outside and Ambien came closer, he could see the purring smile on his face.'
    p1626256393.3948133: '"I am here because I want justice," Ambien bellowed, in a sweet tone. He slammed his fist against Obfus''s chest, with the force of 5874 blue bottles. "I frigging love you, Obfus Curr."'
    p1626256393.3948143: 'Obfus looked back, even more ambivalent and still fingering the peculiar knife. "Ambien, I don''t have the money," he replied.'
    p1626256393.3948152: 'They looked at each other with active feelings, like two motionless, magnificent maggots laughing at a very considerate bar mitzvah, which had classical music playing in the background and two caring uncles thinking to the beat.'
    p1626256393.394816: 'Obfus studied Ambien''s  wide warts and spiky eyelashes. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I''m sorry, but I can''t give you justice," he explained, in pitying tones.'
    p1626256393.394817: 'Ambien looked irritable, his body raw like a mighty, modern map.'
    p1626256393.3948178: 'Obfus could actually hear Ambien''s body shatter into 3833 pieces. Then the loving elephant hurried away into the distance.'
    p1626256393.3948188: 'Not even a glass of wine would calm Obfus''s nerves tonight.'
